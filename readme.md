## Inspiration

In today's digital age, the curriculum and way of teaching seems to be quite boring due to which curiosity and interest of learning something new is diminishing in children. So, we aimed to teach students in a modern way in the form of a game.

## What it does?

Code Rangers is an educational game which will help invoke the interest of students in coding. Herein , there are different adventures(levels) , each level introduces the user to a keyword , thus introducing them to the basic syntax or the basic-blocks of programming. Before each level , we display an adventure guide which consists of basic definitions and explanation pf the keywords. Then the fun begins! As the useer moves towards the level , they get a keyword which they have to guess right. Before moving to the next level , we explain the rightly guessed keyword. Isn't it amazing how the user starts learning while playing game that too  without even realising !!
We have also built a leaderboard which will maintain the levels of students and will create a healthy competition and kids will want to play more. 

## How we built it?

We built it using unity and c#.
We explored and incorporated assests from itch.io and used github for file management. 

## Challenges we ran into?

It was our first time using Unity. Our team decided to work and explore a completely new domain.
It was quite a challenge to not only learn about c# and unity but also make a working game in it that too only in 24 hours!! But hurray we made it.



## Accomplishments that we're proud of?

We are proud that this project is ready for use.
Most importantly we are proud of ourselves as we learnt and implemented everything and made an amazing game in just 24 hours.

## Installation

For the basic start, you can install Unity Hub(Latest LTS Version).
After that, just install your editor of choice with your C# Support.
And that's it you are all done with your installation.

## Future Scopes

For our future scope we aim to scale this game to institution level and add more adventures, and proper leaderboard system which not only keeps track of a student's level but an institution's level also among other partner schools to encourage a healthy competition among our clientele.
We will also be creating the user database to persist the data and keep track of the high scorers of our game. This will give students a reason to take interest in the game and most importantly give them the knowledge of coding universe.
